Enumeration A standard nmap scan shows that ssh is running on port 22 and an Apache web server is running on port 80.

Scanning and Enumeration First thing to note about this box is it seems to have some odd things port wise. Example of that below. The only port that should be open is 8080.

That's probably not good, right?One of the syscalls can be convinced to leak the kernel stack. Find the leak and you'll receive a flag.
