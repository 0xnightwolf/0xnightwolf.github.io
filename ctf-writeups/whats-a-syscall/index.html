<p>Challenge Description</p>
<pre><code>Syscall 14 is known as &quot;SANDBOX_SPECIAL&quot;... I wonder if that would be useful here.

You'll be stuck in a never ending loop of binexec until you perform syscall 14.

To learn about syscalls and how they work in pwnyOS, check out the documentation!

<p>We start out with a welcome screen and are told that we are in a sandbox.</p>
<p><img  src="/img/Sandbox.png"
        alt/></p>
<p>We are further told that we can write shell code in hex and then run it by typing the word <code>done</code> and hitting enter.</p>
<p>Before we get too deep into this challenge lets go over some concepts that will make our life immensely easier, syscalls and shellcode.</p>
<p><strong>SysCalls</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>SysCalls are a way for users process to make a request of the kernel. They are typically made by user process. Most modern operating systems have far more than the 16 in pwnyOS but the concept is the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Shellcode</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shellcode, is often thought of as code that is used to launch a shell. It is typically written in machine code which is a programming language that directly controls the CPU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we have some definitions we can understand that our goal is to write some code that executes a specific piece of code. By doing this we should be able to retrieve the flag.</p>
<p>We start by checking out the documentation and quickly identify &ldquo;syscall 14&rdquo; the <code>SANDBOX_SPECIAL</code>
<a href="https://github.com/sigpwny/pwnyOS-2020-docs/blob/master/Syscalls.pdf">https://github.com/sigpwny/pwnyOS-2020-docs/blob/master/Syscalls.pdf</a></p>
<p>Now you may say that you don&rsquo;t know assembly let alone machine language. Fortunately, for us we have an example that was helpfully included in the documentation. We can also see that this is i386 bytecode.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sigpwny/pwnyOS-2020-docs/blob/master/Getting_Started.pdf">https://github.com/sigpwny/pwnyOS-2020-docs/blob/master/Getting_Started.pdf</a></p>

<p><del>Unfortunately, it is written in AT&amp;T syntax.</del></p>
<ul>
<li>First, we move the address we are running our code from into <code>eax</code></li>
<li>Second, we move <code>14</code> (the value of the SANDBOX_SPECIAL syscall) into <code>eax</code></li>
<li>Third, we call interrupt with 0x80, which tells the system we want to execute a syscall.</li>
<li>Finally, we call ret.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>movl $0x0804c0a0, %eax
movl $14, %eax
int $0x80
ret
</code></pre><p>Cool. Now that we can visualize this in the assembly. We can do a few different things. We can try to compile but I had some challenges getting it to work. I was able to use both the example assembly, shellcode, and very handy discord bot called &ldquo;REBot&rdquo; to work out the shellcode needed line by line.</p>
<pre><code>b2 a0 c0 04 08 8d 1d 15 00 00 00 01 d8 b8 0e 00 00 00 cd 80 c3
</code></pre><p><img  src="/img/SysCall.png"
        alt/></p>
<p>We grab the flag, hit enter, and are dropped into a &ldquo;Rash&rdquo; shell. Ready to tackle the next challenge.</p>
