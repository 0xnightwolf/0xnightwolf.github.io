Scanning and Enumeration First thing to note about this box is it seems to have some odd things port wise. Example of that below. The only port that should be open is 8080. There isn&rsquo;t anything to do with the other ports and we aren&rsquo;t sure why it shows up consistently.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/htb-writeups/tabby-writeup/">

But we chaining an LFI allows us to make use of it. Containers also prove to be useful for more than what they were intended for.
