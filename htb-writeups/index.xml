      <description>Intro Passage is a Ubuntu box. It had a few privesc and a few tricks up it&amp;rsquo;s sleeve to prevent what you might typically do for initial enumeration.
Enumeration A standard nmap scan shows that ssh is running on port 22 and an Apache web server is running on port 80.
sudo nmap -sV -sC -Pn -oA Passage 10.10.10.206 Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-19 17:14 MDT Nmap scan report for 10.</description>

      <description>Doctor has a &amp;ldquo;secure&amp;rdquo; message board system that allows us to gain code execution. From there, we access logs, find credentials, and privilege escalate to root by taking advantage of our local access to Spulnkd.
Enumeration sudo nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.209 -oA Doctor Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-18 19:07 UTC Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.209 Host is up (0.11s latency). Not shown: 997 filtered ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.</description>

      <description>Omni is a Easy machine from HTB. The info card features a question mark in place of the OS. It&amp;rsquo;s something a little bit different than normal. I would sharpen your PowerShell skill though.
Enumeration We start off with an NMAP scan and see a whole bunch of open port on what seems to be a Windows machine.
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.204 Host is up (0.081s latency). Not shown: 65529 filtered ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 135/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC 5985/tcp open upnp Microsoft IIS httpd 8080/tcp open upnp Microsoft IIS httpd | http-auth: | HTTP/1.</description>

      <description>OpenKeyS is an OpenBSD box that features CVE 2019-19521 as an vulnerability that allows you to gain access to user and ultimately root.
Enumeration We start off with an NMAP scan we can see that there are two open ports. 22 for SSH and 80 for OpenBSD httpd.
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.199 Host is up (0.079s latency). Not shown: 998 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.</description>

      <guid>/htb-writeups/buff-writeup/</guid>
      <description>Buff is a windows box that features the website for a Gym Membership software and a simple Window stack based buffer overflow.
Scanning and Enumeration First thing to note about this box is it seems to have some odd things port wise. Example of that below. The only port that should be open is 8080. There isn&amp;rsquo;t anything to do with the other ports and we aren&amp;rsquo;t sure why it shows up consistently.</description>

      <description>Tabby has a Tomcat server that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have vulnerability we can exploit. But we chaining an LFI allows us to make use of it. Containers also prove to be useful for more than what they were intended for.
Scanning and enumeration We start off, as always, with an NMAP scan to get an idea of what we are working with.

      <description>Blunder is a box that starts with a Bludit based blog being used to store random facts and a Sudoers file was configured with the intent to prevent us from running bash as root. It was less than sucessful.
Scanning and Enumeration We start off with a basic nmap scan.
sudo nmap -sV -sC 10.10.10.191 Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-21 08:44 MDT Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.191 Host is up (0.</description>

      <description>Admirer is a Linux box that features a vulnerable database setup and leveraging a maliciously crafted python library to achieve root.
Enumeration We start off, as always, with an NMAP Scan.
