      <description>OpenKeyS OpenKeyS is an OpenBSD box that features CVE 2019-19521 as an vulnerability that allows you to gain access to user and ultimately root.
Enumeration We start off with an NMAP scan we can see that there are two open ports. 22 for SSH and 80 for OpenBSD httpd.
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.199 Host is up (0.079s latency). Not shown: 998 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.</description>

      <description>Buff Buff is a windows box that features the website for a Gym Membership software and a simple Window stack based buffer overflow.
Scanning and Enumeration First thing to note about this box is it seems to have some odd things port wise. Example of that below. The only port that should be open is 8080. There isn&amp;rsquo;t anything to do with the other ports and we aren&amp;rsquo;t sure why it shows up consistently.</description>

      <description>Blunder is a box that starts with a Bludit based blog being used to store random facts and a Sudoers file was configured with the intent to prevent us from running bash as root. It was less than sucessful.
Scanning and Enumeration We start off with a basic nmap scan.

      <description>Admirer Admirer is a Linux box that features a vulnerable database setup and leveraging a maliciously crafted python library to achieve root.
Enumeration We start off, as always, with an NMAP Scan.

      <description>Tabby Tabby has a Tomcat server that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have vulnerability we can exploit. But we chaining an LFI allows us to make use of it. Containers also prove to be useful for more than what they were intended for.
Scanning and enumeration We start off, as always, with an NMAP scan to get an idea of what we are working with.
