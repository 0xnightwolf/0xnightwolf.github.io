Enumeration We start off with an NMAP scan we can see that there are two open ports. 22 for SSH and 80 for OpenBSD httpd.
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.199 Host is up (0.079s latency). Not shown: 998 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/buff-writeup/">

Scanning and Enumeration First thing to note about this box is it seems to have some odd things port wise. Example of that below. The only port that should be open is 8080. There isn&rsquo;t anything to do with the other ports and we aren&rsquo;t sure why it shows up consistently.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/tabby-writeup/">

But we chaining an LFI allows us to make use of it. Containers also prove to be useful for more than what they were intended for.
Scanning and enumeration We start off, as always, with an NMAP scan to get an idea of what we are working with.

It was less than sucessful.

That's probably not good, right?One of the syscalls can be convinced to leak the kernel stack. Find the leak and you'll receive a flag. Keep leaking kernel secrets until you see the }.(Hint: finding the leak is half the battle, getting it to leak the entire flag requires some outside the box thinking)Author: raviDisclaimer I was unable to solve this challenge until after the CTF had officially ended.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/whats-a-syscall/">

Syscall 14 is known as &quot;SANDBOX_SPECIAL&quot;... I wonder if that would be useful here.You'll be stuck in a never ending loop of binexec until you perform syscall 14.To learn about syscalls and how they work in pwnyOS, check out the documentation!System Calls in pwnyOS: https://github.com/sigpwny/pwnyOS-2020-docs/blob/master/Syscalls.pdfAuthor: raviSolution We start out with a welcome screen and are told that we are in a sandbox.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/posts/time-to-start/">

Welcome to pwnyOS!!pwnyOS is a custom x86 operating system that supports link-time kASLR, multitasking and kernel threads, execution of genuine ELF files, a realtime high resolution graphics engine, and a custom hierarchical file system. This OS was written from the ground up with its use as a challenge for UIUCTF 2020 in mind. All source code in the OS is 100% custom handwritten C and assembly- there are no libraries used, and none of its code can be found anywhere online.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
